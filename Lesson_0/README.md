# Environment setup

I have started learning cpp on my macbook 2020 with BigSur. The compiler I am using is Clang version 13.0.0. I won't be using any IDE. I will be using VSCode as a text editor to write my code and I will be using CMake to compile and build my projects. My Cmake version is 3.21.2.
